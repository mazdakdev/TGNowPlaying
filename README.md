## Contributions

Contributions are, of course, welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request. For example, here is a step-by-step guide for adding a new provider:

1. Create an Adapter for Your Provider:
Navigate to the `adapters/` directory.
Create a new Python file for your service adapter, e.g., `your_service.py`.
Implement a class that inherits from `ProviderAdapter` and overrides the `fetch_current_item` method.

```python
from TGNowPlaying.adapters.base import ProviderAdapter
from typing import Optional, Tuple

class YourServiceAdapter(ProviderAdapter):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    async def fetch_current_item(self) -> Optional[Tuple[str, str, str]]:
       title = do_sth_and_get_title()
       message = f"Currently doing {title}"
       image = do_sth_and_get_pfp()

       return title, message, image
```

2. Register Your Adapter in the Factory:
Open `factories/provider_factory.py`.
Add an entry for your service in the `_adapters` dictionary.

```python
class ProviderAdapterFactory:
    _adapters = {
        "spotify": SpotifyAdapter,
        "your_service": YourServiceAdapter,  # Add your service here
    }
    ....
```

3. Test and Submit a PR :)
